Please read below our Project Idea:

Medical Inventory/Professional Catalog:
      
Problem Statement:
Most of the hospitals are usually short on medical equipment for COVID19 and they face trouble in collaborating with different vendors to get their equipment for example syringes, PPE, Masks etc.
We are looking to provide an overall view via a dashboard to the vendors/sellers, so that the shortfall of requirements can be met. 

Solution:
We are planning to come up with a catalog of items from different sellers who are close to the hospital/ medical facility in their county/city. Hence there will be a reduction in the turnaround of acquiring the medical equipment.
In this manner the delivery will be much faster than it usually is. 
Our web interface will be to order and keep a record of medical equipment and there shall be an alerting system in place which alerts when an item is falling short of availability by maitaining certain threshold(eg. <20 items).

We are focussing on two broad category of users: 
1.People who require equipment (Hospitals/ Medical staff - Admin) and can post their requirements on the portal.
2 Vendors who can provide them and subsequently post the materials they can provide.
3.(Experimental) Manufacturers who can produce the items and when they are short of the equipment can post availability(expected) of the product.
A dashboard will be in place to cater to the requirements and availability of supplies.
