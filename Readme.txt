Please read below our Project Idea:

Medical Inventory & Professional Database/Catalog:
      


Problem Statement:
Most of the hospitals are usually short on medical equipment for COVID19 and they face trouble in collaborating with different vendors to get their equipment for example syringes, PPE, Masks etc.
We are looking to provide an overall view via a dashboard to the vendors/sellers, so that the shortfall of requirements can be met. 


Solution:

We will be creating a catalogue of the items from all the different sellers who are close to the hospital/ medical facility in their county/city and hence there will be a reduction in the turnaround of acquiring the equipment.
In this manner the delivery will be much faster than it usually is. 
Our web interface will be to order and keep record of equipment and there will be an alerting system in place which alerts when an item is falling short of availability by keeping certain threshold.

There will be two type of users whom we are concerned with: 
1.People who require equipment (Hospitals/ Medical staff - Admin) who can post their requirements on the portal.
2 Vendors who can provide them and subsequently post the materials they can provide.
3.(Experimental) Manufacturers who can produce it and who are short of the equipment can post the availability(expected) of the product.

A dashboard will be in place to cater to the requirements and availability of supplies.
