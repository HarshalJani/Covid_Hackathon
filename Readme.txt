Please read below our Project Idea:

Medical Inventory & Professional Database/Catalog:
      Prob Statement: Many hospital/facilities faced a challenge to quickly gather professionals who could assist on duty for the high number of cases being reported. 
      It was seen that nurses and doctors had to work more than their capacity knowing the scenario of public health. A lack of accessibility towards existing trained
      professionals who may be working other professions or could be called upon was observed. Also, a shortage in inventory of a large amount of accessories and other
      materials was seen by the facilities.
      
      Our Idea: Create a catalog of registered professionals in a county/city/state with information details that could volunteer during such times. A resource of Inventory
      request and management to easily keep track of needs of a facility.
